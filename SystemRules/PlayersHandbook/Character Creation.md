Character Creation can be a bit daunting at times, so here's what to do in what order to have the smoothest experience possible.

### Who are you?
Now then let's get one thing straight. Before you pick out any Components or even do the first steps of creating you Character here we highly recommend that you have a decent idea of who your Character is. FOSSTTRPG does not have classes. There are no preset archetypes or moulds for you to follow when creating your Character. The closest thing you get to that here are what base stats your build will be based on. FOSSTTRPG is designed to be malleable in nature. Able to create and give function to any Character. So before you set out to create your Character you need a goal in mind.

Additionally we highly recommend that you communicate with both your GM and other Players when creating your Character not just to make sure everyone has a good time, but also because they can help you with creating yours. If someone at your table needs help with their Character don't be afraid to give out ideas even if they are dumb. Great things can come from the dumbest of places. Perhaps if you do this some of the Characters end up being related to each-other in some way shape or form before the Campaign begins. (It's not necessary to have pre-established relationships between your Characters in order to have a fun time.)

###### Theme
A Character's theme is the most important part of any Character. It is their lifeblood, and what informs everything about them. But what is a theme?
