Character Creation can be a bit daunting at times, so here's what to do in what order to have the smoothest experience possible.

### Who are you?
Now then let's get one thing straight. Before you pick out any Components or even do the first steps of creating you Character here we highly recommend that you have a decent idea of who your Character is. FOSSTTRPG does not have classes. There are no preset archetypes or moulds for you to follow when creating your Character. The closest thing you get to that here are what base stats your build will be based on. FOSSTTRPG is designed to be malleable in nature. Able to create and give function to any Character. So before you set out to create your Character you need a goal in mind.

Additionally we highly recommend that you communicate with both your GM and other Players when creating your Character not just to make sure everyone has a good time, but also because they can help you with creating yours. If someone at your table needs help with their Character don't be afraid to give out ideas even if they are dumb. Great things can come from the dumbest of places. Perhaps if you do this some of the Characters end up being related to each-other in some way shape or form before the Campaign begins. (It's not necessary to have pre-established relationships between your Characters in order to have a fun time.)

If you have trouble with figuring out who your Character is here's a step by step guide on how to write a Player Character.

*This guide is not a concrete part of the Rules, and should not be treated as such. You and the rest of your table are free to create your Characters however you want.*
###### Theme
A Character's theme is the most important part of any Character. It is their lifeblood, and what informs everything about them. But what is a theme? 
In this context a theme is a statement that defines a Character. Such as "To slice is to converse." or "A hero always helps another". You can have multiple themes, but keeping things simple often yields the best results.
You don't necessarily have to find a theme to build a Character around. However once you have built a Character you can try to find a theme within what you've got. Having a theme in mind will help you not only with role play, but also in what to build your Character into. 

After you've chosen a theme you might already have figured out who your Character is. If you don't feel like you have a good enough grasp you can further flesh out their personality, and backstory. Otherwise feel free to skip ahead to Base Stats.
###### Personality, backstory and everything else.
Generally a Character's personality is informed by their theme, and past aka backstory. You don't necessarily have to write a lengthy backstory. A sentence or two is perfectly fine; anything longer than a page or two can become hard to keep track of so be careful. If you don't have any ideas for a backstory figure out their personality first.
A person's nature along with how they were nurtured both inform how they act today. The same goes for Characters. There are many different pasts that can inform a Character's personality; to find the one that fits your Character think of their theme as their nature, and their past & backstory as how they were nurtured. The lessons they've learned up until the start of the Campaign informs their theme on how to act in various situations. 
Someone happy go lucky might have a theme of "A good smile can heal any heartache.", but their past may be tumultuous, and filled with unimaginable horrors. A Character like this may end up a clown or other kind of entertainer. Smiling away; entertaining others day in, and day out. All to help others be happy in spite of life. Very empathetic to the suffering of others, and able to relate where others can't. Because they're well acquainted with pain; they're unable to bring harm to others. 
If you know where you want your Character's personality to be you can use that in conjunction with your theme to fill out their backstory based on where they ended up. 
Although it is more difficult; the same goes for finding a theme after you've made a personality and backstory. If you can't figure out any concrete themes then adjust their personality and backstory until you can draw the theme out.

From here you can continue to write and flesh out your Character as much as you need in order to get to know them, but the more blank space left in them the more they have room to grow and change over the course of a Campaign. You don't need to have written out all of their likes and dislikes beforehand. If you know your theme, personality, and backstory; you can simply improvise and make something up in the moment. Broad strokes are all you should need. The rest can be filled in and explored as you play as them in the Campaign.

there's more to writing a Character than just this, but this should be good enough to be able to get to know your Character and build them mechanically.
