> This is the introduction to the project and what it's about.

FOSSTTRPG is Free and Open Source Software that is built on an Open Source Table Top Role Playing Game system I am designing. (The name is not permanent as in I really want to change it, but I don't have any good ideas.)

The goal is to have a client that allows you to easily navigate and manage character resources and components with as little mental overhead as possible in order to aid in both character creation and play at physical and virtual tabletops.
Along with easy and accessible indexing of the rules so that any and all rulings can be decided in seconds.

#### The project hasn't been playtested yet. So a majority of rules, and all parameters are subject to change based on feedback from playtesters.

As for the TTRPG portion of the project you can read about all the rules in the [Appendix](Appendix.md) folder.

Obsidian is the primary tool used to write the Markdown files while the software itself will be written in Rust.
